# `unnecessary_host_function_call`

**Default Severity:** `warn`

**Target Resource:** [CPU — host function dispatch and execution](../cost_rationale.md#per-lint-resource-summary)

## What it does

Flags calls to Soroban host functions inside a loop body when the call takes the
same inputs on every iteration.

The lint covers the host accessors reachable from `Env`:

| Accessor                        | Type(s) matched                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `env.ledger()`                  | `soroban_sdk::ledger::Ledger`                                |
| `env.crypto()`                  | `soroban_sdk::crypto::Crypto`, `CryptoHazmat`, `Bls12_381`, `Bn254` |
| `env.prng()`                    | `soroban_sdk::prng::Prng`                                    |
| `env.events()`                  | `soroban_sdk::events::Events`                                |
| `env.deployer()`                | `soroban_sdk::deploy::Deployer`, `DeployerWithAddress`, `DeployerWithAsset` |
| `env.current_contract_address()`| `soroban_sdk::Env`                                           |

Storage accessors (`env.storage()`) are handled by
[`soroban_storage_in_loop`](soroban_storage_in_loop.md) instead, so they are not
reported twice.

## Why is this bad?

{% hint style="danger" %}
Calling a host function crosses the Wasm-host boundary, which incurs `DispatchHostFunction` overhead plus whatever work the function performs. Repeating this unnecessarily inside a loop adds up to **significant CPU waste**, especially when the result is constant across iterations. See the [Cost Rationale — What Dominates](../cost_rationale.md#what-dominates) for the relative cost hierarchy.
{% endhint %}

## Example

```rust
// ❌ Bad: same host call repeated every iteration
for item in items {
    let current_seq = env.ledger().sequence();
}

// ❌ Bad: the hashed input never changes
for _ in 0..n {
    let digest = env.crypto().sha256(&payload);
}
```

```rust
// ✅ Good: the argument changes every iteration, so the call is real work
for chunk in chunks.iter() {
    let digest = env.crypto().sha256(chunk);
}
```

## Suggested Fix

{% hint style="success" %}
Call the host function once before the loop, store the result in a local variable, and reference that variable inside the loop.
{% endhint %}

## What is not reported

A call is left alone when it reads anything that changes between iterations —
the loop variable, a `let` inside the loop body, or a variable mutated by the
loop. Hoisting such a call would change behaviour, so it is not a cost problem
the lint should raise.

When the mutation analysis cannot reach a verdict for a loop, every call in that
loop is left alone rather than reported on incomplete information.

Two gaps remain, and both make the lint report a call it could have skipped:

- Bindings and mutations inside a closure body nested in the loop are not seen.
- Mutation through a raw pointer or through interior mutability (`Cell`,
  `RefCell`) is not tracked.

## Cost impact

A host function call pays `DispatchHostFunction` overhead (crossing from Wasm into the host environment) plus the work the function performs. When the result is constant across loop iterations, every call after the first is pure waste.

Measured with `Env::default()` in the [`cost_benchmarks`](https://github.com/Tollcraft/soroban-cost-linter/tree/main/cost_benchmarks) crate (`cargo test -- --nocapture`):

| Pattern | Iterations | CPU instructions (delta) | Memory bytes (delta) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `env.ledger().sequence()` in loop (bad) | 100 | *run `cargo test -- --nocapture` in `cost_benchmarks/`* | *run `cargo test -- --nocapture` in `cost_benchmarks/`* |
| Hoisted: call once, reuse result (good) | 100 | *run `cargo test -- --nocapture` in `cost_benchmarks/`* | *run `cargo test -- --nocapture` in `cost_benchmarks/`* |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The saving scales **linearly with iteration count**. A loop of 10,000 iterations wastes ~100× what a loop of 100 does. Larger loops see proportionally larger absolute savings.
{% endhint %}

### How to reproduce

```bash
cd cost_benchmarks
cargo test bench_host_fn_inside_vs_outside_loop -- --nocapture
```

## Deliberately not covered

- `env.invoke_contract()`, `env.try_invoke_contract()` and
  `env.authorize_as_current_contract()` — invoking or authorizing per iteration
  is what the loop is for, and the cost is inherent rather than redundant.
- Calls whose per-iteration repetition is intentional, most commonly
  `env.prng()` generators and `env.events().publish()` with constant arguments,
  are still reported: they are metered host calls with unchanged inputs, and the
  lint cannot tell intent. Use `#[allow(unnecessary_host_function_call)]` on
  those call sites.
